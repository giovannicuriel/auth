Configuration
=============

In order to properly start Auth, the following variables can be set. All
values are the default ones.

.. code-block:: shell

  #
  # Database configuration
  #
  # Database type. Current only postgres is supported
  export AUTH_DB_NAME="dojot_auth"
  # The username used to access the database
  export AUTH_DB_USER="kong"
  # The password used to access the database
  export AUTH_DB_PWD=""
  # The address used to connect to the database
  export AUTH_DB_ADDRESS="postgres"
  # The port used to connect to the database
  export AUTH_DB_PORT=5432
  # Automatically create database
  export AUTH_DB_CREATE="True"

  #
  # Users and password configuration
  #

  # E-mail server through which reset password e-mails are going to be sent
  # If set to "" then default password is going to be ${AUTH_USER_TMP_PWD} and
  # passwords can be reset directly by API requests.
  export AUTH_SMTP_ADDRESS=""
  # E-mail server port to connect
  export AUTH_SMTP_PORT=587
  # E-mail server uses TLS (or not)
  export AUTH_SMTP_TLS="true"
  # E-mail server user account
  export AUTH_SMTP_USER=""
  # E-mail server user passord
  export AUTH_SMTP_PASSWD=""
  # If you are using a front end with Auth, define this link to point to the 
  # password reset view on you frontend page
  export AUTH_EMAIL_PWD_VIEW=""
  # User default password if ${AUTH_SMTP_ADDRESS} is set to ""
  export AUTH_USER_TMP_PWD="temppwd"
  # Password request expiration time (in minutes)
  export AUTH_PASSWD_REQUEST_EXP=30
  # How many passwords should be checked on the user history to enforce no
  # password repetition policy
  export AUTH_PASSWD_HISTORY_LEN=4
  # Minimum valid password length.
  export AUTH_PASSWD_MIN_LEN=8
  # Path to password blacklist file
  export AUTH_PASSWD_BLACKLIST="password_blacklist.txt"

  #
  # Auth cache configuration
  #

  # Type of cache used. Currently only Redis is suported.
  # If set to 'NOCACHE' auth will work without cache. 
  # Disabling cache usage considerably degrades performance.
  export AUTH_CACHE_NAME="redis"
  # username to access the cache database
  export AUTH_CACHE_USER="redis"
  # password to acces the cache database
  export AUTH_CACHE_PWD=""
  # ip or hostname where the cache can be found
  export AUTH_CACHE_ADDRESS="redis"
  # Redis port
  export AUTH_CACHE_PORT=6379
  # Cache entry time to live in seconds
  export AUTH_CACHE_TTL=720
  # cach database name (or number)
  export AUTH_CACHE_DATABASE="0"


  #
  # General configuration
  #

  # Expiration time in second for generated JWT tokens
  export AUTH_TOKEN_EXP=420
  # Default output for logging. The other valid options is "SYSLOG"
  export AUTH_SYSLOG="STDOUT"

  #
  # Other services
  #

  # The URL where the Kong service can be found.
  # If set to "", Auth wonÂ´t try to configure Kong and will generate secrets for
  # the JWT tokens by itself.
  export KONG_URL="http://kong:8001"
  # Where Data Broker is
  export DATA_BROKER_URL="http://data-broker"
  # Kafka address
  export KAFKA_ADDRESS="kafka"
  # Kafka port
  export KAFKA_PORT=9092
  # Where RabbitMQ can be accessed
  export RABBITMQ_ADDRESS="rabbitmq"
  # Port used by RabbitMQ instance
  export RABBITMQ_PORT=15672

  #
  # dojot variables
  #

  # Global subject to use when publishing tenancy lifecycle events
  export DOJOT_SUBJECT_TENANCY="dojot.tenancy"
  # Global service to use when publishing dojot management events
  # such as new tenants
  export DOJOT_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT="dojot-management"


If you are running a standalone instance of Auth (without docker), then you
need to create a user and a database first. This could be done by the following
command:

.. code-block:: shell


  createuser -h ${AUTH_DB_ADDRESS}:${AUTH_DB_PORT} -d ${AUTH_DB_USER}
  createdb -h ${AUTH_DB_ADDRESS}:${AUTH_DB_PORT} ${AUTH_DB_USER}


Remember that these commands uses a simple and not properly secured instance of
PostgreSQL. If you are using a public environment or a PostgreSQL service
from a cloud provider, check the proper documentation on how to create users
and databases.

After creating a user and a database for it, you should execute the following
command to create all other tables in Auth database.

.. code-block:: shell

  python3 -m auth.initialConf
  gunicorn auth.webRoutes:app \
      --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 \
      --reload \
      -R \
      --access-logfile - \
      --log-file - \
      --env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
      -k gevent


Remember that the ${AUTH_PASSWD_BLACKLIST} file is relative to where these two
commands are run.
